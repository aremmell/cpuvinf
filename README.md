CPUVInf is a tiny, simple and useful diagnostics tool for the Raspberry Pi minicomputer series written purely in shell scripting language. It is compatible with all Raspberry Pi 1 and all Raspberry Pi 2 minicomputers and therefore with all available Linux based operating systems for the Raspberry Pi series. It started off as a small script to read CPU temperature and voltage but has become much more than that.<br /><br /><br />
