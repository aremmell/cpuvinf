<B>What is CPUVINF?</B><br /><br />
CPUVInf is a tiny, simple and useful diagnostics tool for the Raspberry Pi minicomputer series written purely in shell scripting language. It is compatible with all Raspberry Pi 1 and all Raspberry Pi 2 minicomputers and therefore with all available Linux based operating systems for the Raspberry Pi series. It started off as a small script to read CPU temperature and voltage but has become much more than that.<br /><br /><br />
<B>Full list of compatible OS:</B>
<ul>
<li>Raspbian</li>
<li>Pidora</li>
<li>Arch Linux ARM</li>
<li>Ubuntu MATE</li>
<li>Snappy Ubuntu Core</li>
<li>Media center Distros with access to console based on one of the above listed OS
</ul><br /><br />
<B>Features:</B><br /><br />
CPU & GPU Temperature<br />
CPUVInf can read CPU and GPU temperatures from the hardware sensors. Conversion of the sensor output is done into °F/°C values.<br /><br />
CPU & GPU Clocks<br />
CPUVInf can retrieve the minimum, maximum and current CPU and GPU clocks. Moreover it is also possible to retrieve the CPU governer. Output is converted into MHz values.<br /><br />
System Voltages<br />
CPUVInf is capable of reading various system voltages and converting the output into Volt values. Voltage types: core, SDRAM core, SDRAM I/O and SDRAM PHY voltages.<br /><br />
Memory Split<br />
CPUVInf can display the assigned RAM for the internal GPU and system RAM (usable RAM) in MB values.<br />
